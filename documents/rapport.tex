\begin{abstract}
  This thesis studies a possible futur implementation of a betatron
  tune measurement in the \gls{LHC} at \gls{CERN} using a \gls{GPGPU}
  to analyse data acquired with the \gls{ADT}. The present hardware
  and future possible implementations using \gls{ADT} acquisitions and
  \gls{GPU} computing are described. The \gls{ADT} data have to be
  processed to extract the \gls{tune}. To compute the tune, the signal
  is transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using
  \gls{FFT} on \glspl{GPU}. We show that it is possible to achieve one
  order of magnitude faster \glspl{FFT} on a Fermi generation
  \gls{GPU} than what can be done using a i7 generation
  \gls{CPU}. This makes online per \gls{bunch} \gls{FFT} computation
  and betatron tune measurement possible.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I wish to thank \gls{CERN} and the \gls{Hepia} for making this master
thesis possible. I also wish to thank: Dr. Andy Butterworth and
Dr. Ing. Erk Jensen who supported me in my decision to make this
master thesis; Dr. Wolfgang H{\"o}fle for suggesting that I use GPU in
this particular field and for his supervision; Dr. Daniel Valuch for
the assistance on the damper and for all his ideas; Dr. Rama Calaga
for the help on the mathematics of \gls{SVD} and his many
suggestions. Finaly, I wish to thank Prof. Dr. Paul Albuquerque who
was my professor and supervisor during the entire thesis as well as
his assistant Pierre Kunzli.
