\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	This paper study a possible futur implementation of the betatron tune measurement in the \gls{LHC} at the \gls{CERN} using \gls{GPGPU} to analyse data from the \gls{damper} acquisition. It start by describing the present hardware and the future possible implementations using the \gls{ADT} acquisitions. The \gls{ADT} data have to be processed to be able to extract the \gls{tune}. To get the tune the method used is to move the signal from temporal domain to frequency domain using \gls{FFT} on \glspl{GPU}.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
	I wish to thank \gls{CERN} and \gls{Hepia} to have made this master thesis possible. I also wish to thank Dr. Andy Butterworth and Dr. Ing. Erk Jensen who supported me on the choice to make this master thesis, Dr. Wolfgang H{\"o}fle for suggesting that I use GPU in this particular field and supervising. Dr. Valuch for the assistance on the damper and for all the ideas. Dr. Rama Calaga for the help on the mathematics of \gls{SVD} and hints. Finaly, I wish to thank Pr. Paul Albuquerque who was my professor and supervisor during the whole thesis.
