\begin{abstract}
	This thesis studies a possible futur implementation of a betatron tune measurement in the \gls{LHC} at the \gls{CERN} using a \gls{GPGPU} to analyse data acquired with the transverse \gls{damper}. It start by describing the present hardware and the future possible implementations using the \gls{ADT} acquisitions and the \gls{GPU} computing. The \gls{ADT} data have to be processed to extract the \gls{tune}. To get the tune, the method used is to transform the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain using \gls{FFT} on \glspl{GPU}. We show that it is possible to achieve one order of magnitude faster \glspl{FFT} on a Fermi generation \gls{GPU} than what can be done using a i7 generation \gls{CPU}. This makes online per \gls{bunch} \gls{FFT} computation and betatron tune measurement possible.

	I wish to thank \gls{CERN} and the \gls{Hepia} to have made this master thesis possible. I also wish to thank Dr. Andy Butterworth and Dr. Ing. Erk Jensen who supported me on the choice to make this master thesis, Dr. Wolfgang H{\"o}fle for suggesting that I use GPU in this particular field and supervising. Dr. Daniel Valuch for the assistance on the damper and for all the ideas. Dr. Rama Calaga for the help on the mathematics of \gls{SVD} and his many suggestions. Finaly, I wish to thank Prof. Dr. Paul Albuquerque who was my professor and supervisor during the entire thesis as well as his assistant Pierre Kunzli.
