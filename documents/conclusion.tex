\chapter{Conclusion}

This project looks like a nice place to try using \glspl{GPU} in accelerators. The possibilities are promising and the gain for the stability of the \gls{LHC} could allow more physic time. \Glspl{GPU} could prove to be useful and be used in other places in accelerators where computing power is needed.
